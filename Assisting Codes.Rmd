## Remove column from dataset using subset

```{r}


merged_trips <- subset(merged_trips, select = -c(start_station_id_copy))

```


## Create a test dataset

```{r}
tester <- merged_trips[merged_trips$start_lat == "",]
tester <- merged_trips[is.na(merged_trips$end_lat),]
```

## Merge column using ifelse
```{r}
merged_trips$start_station_id_copy <- ifelse(!merged_trips$start_station_id_copy == "", merged_trips$start_station_id_copy, start_station_ids_found)
merged_trips$start_station_name_copy <- ifelse(!merged_trips$start_station_name_copy == "", merged_trips$start_station_name_copy, start_station_names_found)
```


## Add a column using another vector

```{r}
merged_trips$start_station_id_copy <- merged_trips$start_station_id
merged_trips$start_station_name_copy <- merged_trips$start_station_name
```
