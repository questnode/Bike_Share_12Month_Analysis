Welcome to my case study on a 12 Month Analysis of a bike share program.  This is an unguided project based on data provided between November 2021 to October 2022. The core purpose is to find out how annual members and casual riders use the bikes differently.  

There are a couple constraints and challenges met while conducting the analysis.
1. Since this an online case study, there are actually no stakeholder to inquire regarding missing or erroneous data.  Therefore, either best assumptions are made, or the data entries in question are discarded.
2. One challenge is the quantity of data being over 5.6 Million entries of 12 observations each. The programming language R is chosen for its performance being a localized IDE and having a vectorian data structure.
